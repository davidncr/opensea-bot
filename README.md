Trade NFTs in your sleep with OpenSea Bot by David Nikolic. Buy more. Sell more. Earn more.

Fixed price offers
Send fixed price offers on your selected listings or collections with specific traits [e.g., 0.01 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)]. Never pay more than you want.

Relative price offers
Adjust your offers based on the collection’s floor price [set at 80% of the floor price so you can sell a collection for a healthy profit margin… as soon as tomorrow].

Custom offer expiration
Automatically withdraw listing offers after a set amount of time has passed [great for time-sensitive collections or for automatically clearing offers without having to keep a reminder about them].

Bid based on specific traits
Select listings you want to bid on. Automate offers on collections with specific traits so you never miss out because you couldn’t log in to OpenSea.
